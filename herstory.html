				<div display="block"><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Camilla DePaola celebrated 106 years of a joyous life. Her loving spirit has been inspirational to all who have been fortunate to know her. She was grateful for every moment that she could be in the company of others. All were welcome to share in her laughter, her wit, her wisdom.  Through her humanity Camilla taught us that life is about loving and caring for each other. She will be sadly missed.  </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">She was born Camilla Aquilino, the fourth of 8 children to Anna and Rocco in Castel Baronia, Italy just before WWI. At that time in Italy (1911 to 1918) only boys went to school. But as Camilla tells the tale girls were the fortunate ones. Girls learned real life skills; how to feed whole communities, how to trade, how to live off the land, sanitation, how to treat illnesses. Girls ruled.  She was 7 by the end of the war and was already working the family farm and caring for grand-parents and younger siblings. As a seven-year-old she was already enterprising. She learned from dad, Rocco, about merchandising.  Any surplus farm products that they could bundle, they would sell or trade to earn a living. Dad would mount sacks of peppers, beans, fruit and olives onto the family mule. Rocco had to walk the mule to other towns to trade for wheat and other items his family needed. Her mother, Anna, would give Camilla surplus heads of lettuce and send her to town center to sell them. Her mom expected 2 cents per head. Camilla would sell 2 heads for 5 cents and keep 1 cent for herself. She would save her pennies until she earned enough to buy spools of cotton. She would knit socks from cotton and sell the socks. </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">We know from her brothers that Camilla would always share her good fortune, not only with siblings but with neighbors. She was quite popular because she might show up with goodies in her apron pocket; perhaps a small sack of sweet olives; or – everyone’s favorite – roasted-salted chickpeas to crunch on. The skills she learned (without a day of formal schooling) would sustain her for the next 100 years. But it was her simplicity of life that made for a richness of life that was beyond any monetary wealth. Camilla loved farm life, she loved the people of Castel Baronia, and she loved her extended family. Her love for family and friends, her strong work ethic and her devout Christian faith afforded her the sweet life (la dolce vita). </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">At the age of 26, with her mom’s and dad’s approval, Camilla married Vincenzo DePaola and they moved to Flumeri, Avellino. For a time both Camilla and Vincenzo worked as tailors but by WWII work was increasingly scarce. Camilla ignored despair and looked for opportunity. She applied for, and received, license to be a bread baker for her town. She had to stretch government rationed wheat each day to provide bread for the families of Flumeri. At 3:00 AM each day and again at noon Camilla would use her brute strength to manually kneed 70 kilos of dough at a time. She set up an entire enterprise to: collect fuel (in the form of fire wood), pump and carry water, maintain equipment (she rented an oven from a retired baker),  hired help and manage distribution.  During the war she also served as a wet nurse for newborns in town because not all mothers were able to provide. At that time she had beloved sons Dino and Albert. Albert sadly died from appendicitise at the age of 7 – Camilla would cry at the mention of her son, Albert, for the rest of her life. Seemingly against all odds, Camilla maintained a contagious, can-do attitude throughout her life. By war’s end wheat rationing ended and her family again found work hard to come by. Vincenzo, back from the army, managed to continue working as a tailor, but in a small town there were relative few weddings and funerals to provide suits for. Camilla, applied for and received a license to sell wine. So Vince and Camilla converted the front room of their single story rented flat to a tavern. They made their own wine, bread, cheeses and sausage and ran a tavern. Son, Dino, would sweep the floors and do the heavy lifting moving gallons of wine from cellar to tavern.   </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">By 1956, Vincenzo and Camilla had 2 more children, Maria (Albertina) and Antonio (Toni). Dino was a resident at the Dominican monastery. Like many others, Camilla and Vincenzo emigrated to the USA in search of better opportunity for the family. Dino completed his studies and joined the family in the US in 1960.  </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">It was Camilla’s and Vincenzo’s ambition to own property in the US. They both worked as tailors and were eventually able to buy a 2 family house in Irvington. They converted it to 3 families, and earned enough from rent to provide for themselves into retirement. The passing of husband, Vincenzo, in 1996 left her somewhat alone to deal with aging but even at 86 she aged on with grace and laughter.  Even after the unbearable tragedy of losing son Dino in 2000, her spirit was severely shaken but never broken. The power of prayer sustained her. She was 91 but couldn’t give up because she had grandchildren to love and who loved her back. As immigrants Vince and Camilla made their American dream happen. They were thankful for what they accomplished but Camilla always described herself as fortunate because of the relationships she enjoyed. </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">Camilla and Vincenzo were proud to maintain their Italian friendships and to make new friends in America. Many family members who were already in the US, or who came later, immigrated in close proximity. Many paesani from Flumeri also are close and have all maintained lifelong friendships. She moved to Morris Plains and again made new friends who love her like they’ve been part of her family. As always, Camilla welcomed connections with others. When she moved to Morris View nursing home with a broken hip, she made more new friends that love her like family. The staff at Morris View is as sad as we all are. Camilla was on this earth as a gift to those of us who know and love her. She taught us that caring for each other comes natural and that the more we care, the more we get back. </div><div class="_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa">At Camilla’s 95th birthday party we each put together an anecdote describing a connection to Camilla or a unique experience that reminds us of her. She invites you to do the same now by posting any kind words that come to mind. Tell us what you know about Camilla. Ask what you’d like to know more about. Camilla’s life story can be written from many perspectives; and each is as enjoyable as the next. Send her love and kisses. Camilla lives for love and kisses.</div></div>
